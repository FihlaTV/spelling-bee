My daughter Emilia took part in a spelling bee on February 17, 2011, so I wrote
a program to help her practice for it.

The first program I wrote (bee.sh) is a command line program that uses espeak
to read out the word and the spelling. She used this version with her
classmates to practice for the real thing.

The second program is an HTML version () that uses jQuery and Google Translate's
text-to-speech function.
