My daughter Emilia took part in a spelling bee on February 17, 2011, so I wrote
a couple of programs to help her practice for it.

The first program I wrote (bee.sh) is a Linux command line program that uses
espeak to read out the word and the spelling. She used this version with her
classmates to practice for the real thing.

The second program is an HTML version that uses jQuery and Google
Translate's text-to-speech function. It should work in most modern
browsers. Due to cross-domain restrictions from Google Translate it only
works locally, so just open index.html in a browser.
